tools/README

The tool directory contains several tools that may be essential or useful in E-Maj development:
- gen_emaj.pl is a perl script that process the sql/emaj_src.sql file script,
- regress.sh is a shell script that select and execute regression tests,
- copy2Expected.sh is a shell script that copy the result files of regression tests environment to the reference directory.


gen_emaj.pl
-----------
The gen_emaj.pl perl script transforms the sql/emaj_src.sql into 2 scripts, one used to install E-Maj as a common all_in_one script, and the other that will be used to install E-Maj as an extension (once the current limitations in extension management will disappear).
It is used by the regress.sh tool before displaying its menu so that any test run can use its proper install script.

Customisation:
At the beginning of the script (near line 18), the variable $dir is initialized with the emaj project root directory. You must adapt its value to fit your installation.


regress.sh
----------
The regress.sh script is the key tool to perform regression tests. It executes scenarios located into the test directory. These scenarios use sql scripts located into the test/sql directory. The output files are stored into the test/<pg_version>/results directory and compared with reference files located into the test/<pg_version>/expected directory.
Several types of tests are available:
- the standard set of tests starting with the emaj installation,
- a dump of an emaj environment from a cluster in one postgres version and a restore in another cluster running another postgres version,
- the standard set of tests starting with the installation of the prior emaj version followed by the migration script,
- some specific tests including an emaj version migration in the middle of the operations.
To complete the standart tests scenarios, a test of the parallel rollback client is run.

Customisation:
First, some symbolic links must be created so that the unique test/sql directory can be used for all postgres version test environment. To do this, just issue for each postgres version the following command:
    ln -s test/sql test/<pg_version>/sql
Similarly, a symbolic link has to be created to reach the emaj.sql script:
    ln -s sql/emaj.sql test/sql/emaj.sql
Then the regress.sh script must be adapted.
At the beginning of the script (near line 8), the variable EMAJ_HOME is initialized with the emaj project root directory. Then, for each installed postgres version, 3 variables are initialized:
- PGBIN<version> is the postgres binary path
- PGPORT<version> is the ip port of the cluster running this postgres version
- PGREG<version> points to the directory that hosts the standart regress tool
You must adapt these values to fit your installation.
At the end of the script, a menu is displayed to propose all available tests. You must adapt it to your environment.


copy2Expected.sh
----------------
The copy2Expected.sh is a shell script that copy the result files of regression tests environment to the reference directory. Once result regression test files are considered as representing a new reference, you can simply execute the script by typing:
    sh copy2Expected.sh

Customisation:
At the beginning of the script (near line 7), the variable EMAJ_HOME is initialized with the emaj project root directory. You must adapt its value to fit your installation.
Then for each available major postgres version on the environment, 2 commands copy the ouput test files from the /results to the /expected directories. You must adapt the script to your installed major postgres versions.

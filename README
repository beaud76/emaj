E-Maj: logs and rollbacks table updates

Version: 0.10.0

2- Objectives

The main goals of E-Maj are:
	- log updates performed on a set of tables.
	- cancel these updates if needed, and reset this set of tables to a predefined stable state.

In development environments, it brings a good help in testing application, providing an easy way to rollback all updates generated by programs execution, and replay these processings as many times as needed.

In production environments, it brings a good solution to: 
	- set inter-batch savepoints on group of tables,
	- easily "restore" this group of tables at a stable state, without being obliged to stop the cluster,
	- handle several savepoints during batch windows, each of them been usable at any time as "restore point".

It brings a good alternative to the management of several disk images.

4- How to install and use E-Maj

All the information detrails needed to install and use E-Maj are provided in the user's guide that is included in the supplied .tar file.

Remark: The user's guide also presents an emaj plugin for phpPgAdmin. In its current implementation, this plugin is very invasive inside phpPgAdmin code. For this reason, this plugin is currently not yet available on pgfoundry. But if you wish to get a copy, simply ask me.


5- Support

Any feedback is welcome, even to just notice you use E-Maj.

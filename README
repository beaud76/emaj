2- Objectives

The main goal of E-Maj is to be able to logicaly restore a set of tables to a predefined stable state, without been obliged to restore a whole database or cluster.

It brings a good solution to: 
	- set inter-batch savepoints on group of tables,
	- easily "restore" this group of tables at a stable state, without being obliged to stop the cluster,
	- handle several savepoints during batch windows, each of them been usable at any time as "restore point",

It brings a good alternative to the management of several disk images.

Used in development or test environments, it may also bring a good help in testing application, providing an easy way to rollback all updates generated by programs execution and replay these processings as many times as needed.

4- How to install and use E-Maj

All the information needed to install and use E-Maj is provided in the user's guide that is included in the supplied tar file.

Remark: The user's guide presents an emaj plugin for phpPgAdmin. In its current implementation, this plugin is very invasive 
inside phpPgAdmin code. For this reason, this plugin is currently not yet available on pgfoundry. But if you wish to get a copy,
simply ask me.

phpPgAdmin plug-in overview
===========================

To make E-Maj use easier, a **plug-in for the phpPgAdmin** administration tool in its versions 5.1 and higher is also available.

For databases into which the E-Maj extension has been installed, and if the user is connected with a role that owns the required rights, all E-Maj objects are accessible.

It is then possible to:

* define or modify groups content,
* see the list of tables groups and perform any possible action, depending on groups state (create, drop, start, stop, set or remove a mark, rollback, add or modify a comment),
* see the list of the marks that have been set for a group, and perform any possible action on them (delete, rename, rollback, add or modify a comment),
* get statistics about log tables content and see their content,
* monitor in progress rollback operations.
